# rtl-dab

DAB/DAB+ receiver to use with rtl-sdr sticks

Features:
* Only Mode I supported.

### This project uses snippets from:

* David Crawley https://github.com/chrisa/opendab GPL, v3
* Phil Karn http://www.ka9q.net/code/fec/ GPL
* Andreas MÃ¼ller https://github.com/andrmuel/gr-dab GPL, v3


### Status:

#### 01/10/2012

* FIC decoding (i.e. correct crc check) works, however source files need to be cleaned up and added to repository.

#### 05/11/2014

* Finally I found the motivation to work again on this project
